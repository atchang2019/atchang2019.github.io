    <p> <em> Kingsman: The Golden Circle (directed by Matthew Vaughn) </em> was easily one of the funniest, most action-packed movies of 2017. It was full of fighting, adventure, jokes, and some romance. We recommend the film to anyone who wants to walk out the theater dying with laughter and is eager to watch the next Kingsman movie.

    <p> <strong> Top Three Favorite Things </strong> </p>
    <p> 1. Take Me Home, Country Roads - Merlin sang Take Me Home, Country Roads to save the lives of Harry and Eggsy just like Eggsy's father did. Despite being an extremely emotional scene, bringing some Merlin-loving viewers to tears, this part was very memorable and funny because Merlin decided to sacrifice his life in a very interesting and humorous way. </p>
    <p> 2. Elton Jon was without a doubt, the funniest character in the movie. He was always the hopeless performer being imprisoned by the bad guy, but in the end, he was finally able to escape in his own funny way. ("What did you do to me you fucking bitch!") </p>
    <p> 3. Human Shredder - The shredder was in the main antagonist's headquarters. It would shred anything that would upset her. It was memorable because a very cool fight would follow it every time. (Organic Grass-Fed Beef Burger... (it's not beef)) </p>

			<tr> <th>Name</th> <th>Main Role</th> <th><em><strong>F U N</em></strong> Fact</th> </tr>
			<tr> <td>Garry "Eggsy" Unwin</td> <td>The main character who usually saves the world and gets all the pretty women - His father was one of the greatest agents of all time, but Eggsy never knew him.</td> <td>Sorry, Love. Gotta save the world.</td> </tr>
			<tr> <td>Tequila</td><td>The dashing son of the head of Statesman, Kingsman's American counterpart - A strong asset to the Kingsman and a new character to the series who unfortunately, takes the drugs which the Kingsman and Statesman were fighting against - Tequila has always been the "bad boy" of the Statesman.</td><td>Channing Tatum barely had a role in the movie...</td></tr>
			<tr> <td>Harry "Galahad" Hart</td> <td>Former head and recruiter of Kingsman - Formerly thought to be dead, but was alive in Statesman rehab center and had to recover from memory loss - When all his memory was lost, he sought to become a butterfly expert because before the war he was a botanist.</td><td>Manners. Maketh. Man.</td> </tr>
